        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>Our target audience will be individuals and groups who either want to plan a visit or are thinking of moving to Idaho. More specifically men and women ages 20-45 years of age. This age group will typically have families who want to bring their kids on a vacation or individuals looking for a place to get away. This age group is also the most likely to be looking to move, especially young couples looking for a less expensive place to start out.</p>
<h3>Personas</h3>
<p>
    1. Josh and Brandon are best friends and love the outdoors. They want to plan a vacation to stay at a cabin and go cross country skiing in Idaho. They want to know which cities will have the most snow. <br>
    2. Dereck and Kimberlee are the parents of 3 young kids. They are living in an overcrowded apartment in Utah and would like to find a home. Single family homes are out of their price range in Utah so they have begun looking for jobs in Idaho. Although they are use to snow living in Utah, they have been watching the weather in Idaho to see how much more snow they get there than in Utah. After watching for a few months they decide it is worth the change to be able to afford the house.
