            <h2>Negative Space</h2>
            <h3 >West Elm</h3>
            <a class="websites" href="https://www.westelm.com" target="blank">West Elm's Website</a>
            <img src="https://wilsoncari.github.io/cariwilson.github.io/images/WestElmHomePage.jpg" alt="West Elm Home Page.">
            <p>Right at the top of West Elm's home page, there is a large yellow block that creates the perfect negative space for text. In this area they were able to advertise their latest sale in an uncluttered and readable space.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="visual-heirarchy">
            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <h3>Target</h2>
            <a class="websites" href="https://www.target.com" target="blank">Target's Website</a>
            <img src="https://wilsoncari.github.io/cariwilson.github.io/images/TargetHomePage.jpg" alt="Target Home Page">
            <p>When you first open Target's home page, the eye is directly drawn to the white block in the middle of the page advertising a sale on furniture and home decor. The eye is then drawn to the pictures of the furniture directly behind the advertisement where you can click to navigate to the furniture pages. Your sight then moves around the rest of the page depending on what you are looking for. This design principle allowed Target to grab your attention to their sale right off the bat.</p>

        <div class="proximity">
            <h2>Proximity</h2>
            <h3>Restoration Hardware</h2>
            <a class="websites" href="https://rh.com" target="blank">Restoration Hardware's Website</a>
            <img src="https://wilsoncari.github.io/cariwilson.github.io/images/RestorationHardwareHomePage.jpg" alt="Restoration Hardware Home Page">
            <p>The use of proximity is very well done on Restoration Hardware's home page. You will notice their logo up in the left hand corner and in the same bar you have a search icon, shopping bag, and menu. A large picture of their products then separates the nav bar from their first advertisement. This advertisement is contained in a black block. The use of proximity in their text also allows the name "Alison Berger" to stand out as the most improtant info followed by who she is and why she's relevant. The use of proximity organizes the page to create a pleasurable user experience.</p>
